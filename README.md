# Introduction

The project is part of a Full Stack Developer course run by CodeInstitute. This is Milestone Project 2. This project was to create a fun, interactive card matching game for people to pass time with or challenge their friend's and family.

## Space Themed Card Matching Game

A mockup of the game can be seen below:

# Technologies
Technologies used are as follows.
## Languages
* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
  * Used as the main language to code the game's structure.
* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
  * Used to incorporate custom styling into the game and its layout.
* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
  * Used to create the game logic and interactive elements of the game.

## Libraries, Frameworks & Programs Used
1. 

# Testing

Due to the game having no backend functionality, the testing procedure is based on the visual aspect of the game. High level testing includes:
* Running the game on 3 different browsers and simulating responsiveness on each, varying screen sizes will be simulated, ranging from a minimum width of 300px to a maximum width of 3000px:
  * Google Chrome
  * Mozilla Firefox
  * Opera
* No layout items in the containers overlapping other layout items.
* Contact form to require an input in each field prior to submission.
* Game is designed according to the wireframes made prior to coding.

Test Results can be found here: [Test Results](/assets/readme-content/test-result.xlsx)

## Validation
### HTML Validation
"index.html" was run through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), via the direct input method. XXXXXX ANY ISSUES?
### CSS Validation
CSS Stylesheet was run through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), via the direct input method. XXX ANY ISSUES

## Lighthouse Results
Images below show the Lighthouse results on both mobile and desktop:
1. Mobile:<br>![Mobile Lighthouse](xxxmobilelighthouseimagexxx)
1. Desktop:<br>![Desktop Lighthouse](xxxdesktoplighthouseimagexxx)
### Performance
Initially a lower score was given for the Performance category, which was 80. The cause for this was the image sizes. [TinyJPG](https://www.tinyjpg.com/) was used to reduce the file sizes of these images, which increased the score.
### Accessibility
The text of the "Enquire now!" button in the landing page was originally white. This was flagged as a contrast issue and therefore changed to black to make it easier to read.

# Deployment
## Project Creation
To create the project, firstly a Chrome extension called "[Gitpod - Always ready to code](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-always-ready-to-co/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki?hl=en-GB)" was installed. A CodeInstitute template was use by navigating to the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) and clicking the "Use this template" button. The repository was named "KN-Fitness", the checkbox for "Include all branches" was checked and the green "Create repository from template" button was then clicked. From here, the green "GitPod" was then clicked (must use the above extension) and project folders and files created.

Common Git commands were used as follows:
* git add "filename-here" - used to stage files before commiting them.
* git commit -m "message here" - used to commit changes to the local repositry, with the message containing information on the changes that have occured.
* git status - used to check the tracking status of the file in the project.
* git push - used to push the changes to the GitHub repository.

## Publishing
To publish the project I performed the following steps:
1. Navigated to the project's [Github page](XXXLINKTOGITHUBPAGEXXX).
2. Clicked on the "Settings" button.
3. Clicked on the "Pages" button.
4. Under the "Source" heading, changed the "Branch" setting from "None" to "Main", then clicked save.
5. This gave a link to the [published game](XXXLINKTOPUBLISHEDWEBSITEXXX).
## Local Clone
To create a local clone of the project you can follow the steps below:
1. Navigate to the project's [Github page](XXXLINKTOGITHUBPAGEXXX).
2. Click the "Code" dropdown button.
3. From here there are two options:
     * Option 1: Click the "Download ZIP" button to download the files. This can be unzipped locally and opened with your preferred IDE.
     * Option 2: Copy the link from the HTTPS box shown. Then open your preferred IDE of choice and in the terminal window of your preferred directory, use the command "git clone" followed by the link that was copied. For example "git clone XXXLINKHEREFOR.GITXXX". This will clone the files in the selected directory.
